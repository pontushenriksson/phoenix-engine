# Getting started

Firstly we decided on what programming language and graphics API we wanted to utilize. We landed on `Rust` since it is memory safe and blazingly fast, both properties which a game engine benefits from. Secondly we chose `OpenGL` since it is crossplatform and has lots of documentation for us to read and learn from.
